# Role-Specific Logging System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides role-specific activity logging and monitoring for the PG Maintenance Application. Each role (Admin, Superadmin, Support) now has dedicated logging functionality that tracks and displays only relevant activities based on their permissions and responsibilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Role-Specific Services
- **Admin Activities**: Tracks admin-specific actions like resident management, payment processing, room management
- **Superadmin Activities**: Monitors system-wide activities, user management, PG management, and support staff actions
- **Support Activities**: Logs ticket management, user support actions, and support-specific operations

### 2. Role-Based Activity Filtering
- **Admin**: Can view their own activities and activities from their assigned branch
- **Superadmin**: Can view all activities across the system (superadmin + support staff activities)
- **Support**: Can view support-related activities and ticket management actions

### 3. Enhanced Activity Tracking
- Automatic branch association for activities
- Role-specific metadata collection
- Enhanced error handling and status tracking
- IP address and user agent logging

## Backend Implementation

### Updated Files:
1. **`backend/src/services/activity.service.js`**
   - Added role-specific methods: `getAdminActivities()`, `getSuperadminActivities()`, `getSupportActivities()`
   - Enhanced filtering with role-based queries
   - Added branch-specific activity filtering

2. **`backend/src/controllers/activity.controller.js`**
   - New role-specific endpoints for each user type
   - Enhanced error handling and response formatting
   - Role-based statistics and analytics

3. **`backend/src/routes/activity.routes.js`**
   - Added role-specific routes with proper RBAC protection
   - Separate endpoints for admin, superadmin, and support activities

4. **`backend/src/middleware/activity.middleware.js`**
   - Enhanced activity recording with branch information
   - Role-specific activity recording functions
   - Improved metadata collection

## Frontend Implementation

### New Pages Created:
1. **`frontend/src/pages/admin/AdminActivities.jsx`**
   - Admin-specific activity dashboard
   - Filters for admin-related activities
   - Branch-specific activity viewing

2. **`frontend/src/pages/superadmin/SuperadminActivities.jsx`**
   - Superadmin and support staff activity monitoring
   - System-wide activity tracking
   - Advanced filtering and analytics

3. **`frontend/src/pages/support/SupportActivities.jsx`**
   - Support staff activity dashboard
   - Ticket-related activity tracking
   - Support-specific filtering

### Updated Files:
1. **`frontend/src/services/activity.service.js`**
   - Added role-specific API methods
   - Helper function for role-based activity retrieval
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **`frontend/src/App.jsx`**
   - Added new routes for role-specific activity pages
   - Integrated with existing navigation structure

## API Endpoints

### Role-Specific Activity Endpoints:
- `GET /api/activities/admin` - Admin activities
- `GET /api/activities/superadmin` - Superadmin activities  
- `GET /api/activities/support` - Support activities
- `GET /api/activities/stats/role-specific` - Role-specific statistics
- `GET /api/activities/user/:userId/role-specific` - Role-specific user activities
- `GET /api/activities/branch/:branchId/role-specific` - Role-specific branch activities

## Access Control

### Admin Access:
- View their own activities
- View activities from their assigned branch
- Filter by admin-specific categories (resident, payment, room management)

### Superadmin Access:
- View all system activities
- Monitor superadmin and support staff actions
- Access to system-wide analytics and statistics

### Support Access:
- View support-related activities
- Track ticket management actions
- Monitor support staff performance

## Activity Categories

### Admin Activities:
- **Management**: Resident, room, and branch management
- **Financial**: Payment processing and financial operations
- **Authentication**: Login/logout activities

### Superadmin Activities:
- **System**: System management and configuration
- **User Management**: User creation, updates, and management
- **PG Management**: PG creation, updates, and system-wide operations

### Support Activities:
- **Support**: Ticket management and user support
- **Authentication**: Support staff login/logout
- **Communication**: Support-related communications

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Each endpoint is protected with appropriate role permissions
2. **Branch Isolation**: Admin activities are filtered by their assigned branch
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail with IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps
4. **Data Privacy**: Sensitive information is masked in logs

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins:
1. Navigate to `/admin/admin-activities` to view admin-specific activities
2. Use filters to narrow down activities by category, type, or status
3. Export activities to CSV for reporting

### For Superadmins:
1. Navigate to `/superadmin/superadmin-activities` to view system-wide activities
2. Monitor both superadmin and support staff activities
3. Use advanced filtering to track specific operations

### For Support Staff:
1. Navigate to `/support/activities` to view support-related activities
2. Track ticket management and user support actions
3. Monitor support team performance

## Benefits

1. **Improved Security**: Role-based access ensures users only see relevant activities
2. **Better Monitoring**: Each role can monitor their specific operations
3. **Enhanced Compliance**: Complete audit trail for all user actions
4. **Performance Tracking**: Role-specific analytics and statistics
5. **Data Isolation**: Branch-specific activity filtering for admins

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Notifications**: Push notifications for important activities
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Role-specific dashboards with charts and metrics
3. **Automated Alerts**: Alerts for suspicious or failed activities
4. **Activity Scheduling**: Scheduled activity reports and summaries
5. **Integration**: Integration with external monitoring and logging systems

## Technical Notes

- All activities are stored in MongoDB with proper indexing for performance
- Role-based filtering is implemented at the database level for efficiency
- The system supports pagination and search functionality
- Activities are automatically cleaned up after 90 days (configurable)
- Export functionality supports CSV format with role-specific filtering

This implementation provides a comprehensive, secure, and efficient role-specific logging system that enhances the monitoring and auditing capabilities of the PG Maintenance Application.
