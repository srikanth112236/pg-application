console.log('ðŸ§ª Testing QR Form Route Fix...\n');

console.log('ðŸ“‹ Route Fix Applied:');
console.log('1. Changed payment route from /:residentId/mark-paid to /resident/:residentId/mark-paid');
console.log('2. Updated frontend to use new payment route');
console.log('3. This prevents payment routes from catching QR form submissions');

console.log('\nðŸ”§ The Issue Was:');
console.log('- QR form: POST /api/public/qr/{qrCode}/resident');
console.log('- Payment route: POST /api/payments/{residentId}/mark-paid');
console.log('- The {qrCode} was being matched as {residentId}');
console.log('- Payment controller was receiving QR form data');

console.log('\nâœ… The Fix:');
console.log('- Payment route: POST /api/payments/resident/{residentId}/mark-paid');
console.log('- QR form: POST /api/public/qr/{qrCode}/resident');
console.log('- Now they have different patterns and won\'t conflict');

console.log('\nðŸŽ¯ To Test:');
console.log('1. Start the backend server: npm run dev');
console.log('2. Generate a QR code in admin panel');
console.log('3. Scan QR code or visit public URL');
console.log('4. Fill and submit the resident form');
console.log('5. Should see success, not "Payment method is required"');

console.log('\nðŸš€ The QR form should now work without payment validation errors!');
